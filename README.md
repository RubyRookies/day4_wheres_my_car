Project 4: Dude Where's My Car
==============================

> As always, we start the day with user stories. We keep it simple.

* As a user, app knows my current location displayed on a map
* As a user, I would like a street-view displayed in addition to map location
* As a user, I would like to select start and ending location by simply adding a ‘bookmark’ to the beginning and ending locations
* A simple “return to car” button will generate the sequence of return maps
